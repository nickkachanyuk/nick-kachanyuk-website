<p>Intro(Hook):
- Share some insights that Iâ€™ve gained from doing my project
- Provide a short summary to the following research questions:
1) Is there a disproportionate access to water among the different regions of Tanzania?
2) Which variables are important in predicting if a water well is functional, needs repair, or non-functional?</p>
<p>Background/Why is this important?
- Talk about specific examples/testimonies from people who endured the water crisis</p>
<p>Data-related things:
- Talk about what kind of data was used for analysis
- Talk about data cleaning and preparation challenges
- Show examples of bad data management and provide alternative approaches
- Focus on the ethical implications; less on how data was actually cleaned
- Talk about how additional variables were created and what is their purpose</p>
<p>Approach:
- How were the variables selected
- Maybe make some visualizations that show the variables of interest to make a point
- How was the model(s) selected
- If multiple models are to be used; talk about pros and cons of each</p>
<p>Results:
- Answer the 3 research questions (in-summary):
1) What machine learning algorithm approach is most effective at classifying a water well as either functional , need of repair, or non-functional?
2) Is there a disproportionate access to water among the different regions of Tanzania?
3) Which variables are important in predicting if a water well is functional, needs repair, or non-functional?
- How can these findings be used in the real-world</p>
<p>Limitations/Further project direction</p>
